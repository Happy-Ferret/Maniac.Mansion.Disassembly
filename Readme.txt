Maniac Mansion Disassembly
==========================

About
=====

Complete commented disassembly and list of room objects and variables. 


Notes
=====

* This is not meant to be recompilable. At All.
* Certain object numbers will be incorrect, 
   This was caused by an ignored opcode flag in descumm (https://github.com/scummvm/scummvm-tools/pull/12)
